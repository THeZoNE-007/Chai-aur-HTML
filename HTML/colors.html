    <!-- background-color support color formats like 
     hexcode, 
     rgb -> reg-green-blue, 
     hsl -> hue-saturation-light, 
     hwb -> 
     or you can simply write the color name (not efficient since different browsers define different colors with same name) and it's professional to use hexcodes -->

    <!-- In tags like rgb and hsl, you can concatenate another character with them called a -> Alpha Channel (ranges from 0 to 1 in decimals) that can determine the opacity of the color. Ex- rgba(99,255,133,0.5) , etc. -->
